## Types of Internet
Networks are classified into different types based on their scope, connection methods, and functionality. Here's an explanation of the major types:

---

## **1. Based on Area/Scope:**

### **a) PAN (Personal Area Network):**
- **Definition:** A small network limited to a single individual, usually within a small range like a room or personal space.
- **Example:** Bluetooth connections, mobile hotspots, or smartwatches connected to phones.

### **b) LAN (Local Area Network):**
- **Definition:** A network covering a small geographical area, such as a home, office, or school.
- **Example:** Computers connected in an office using Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi.
- **Technology Used:** Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi routers.

### **c) MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):**
- **Definition:** A network that spans a city or a large town, connecting multiple LANs.
- **Example:** Networks used by city governments or metropolitan transport systems.
- **Technology Used:** Fiber optic cables, WiMAX.

### **d) WAN (Wide Area Network):**
- **Definition:** A large network that spans multiple cities, countries, or even continents.
- **Example:** The Internet is the largest WAN.
- **Technology Used:** Satellite links, telecommunication lines.

## **2. Based on Connection Type:**

### **a) Wired Network:**
- Devices are connected using physical cables like Ethernet.
- **Example:** Computers in offices connected with LAN cables.

### **b) Wireless Network:**
- Devices are connected without physical cables using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.
- **Example:** Home Wi-Fi, mobile hotspots.

## **3. Based on Functionality:**

### **a) Client-Server Network:**
- **Definition:** A type of network where one device (server) provides services to other devices (clients).
- **Example:** A web browser requesting a webpage from a web server.

### **b) Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network:**
- **Definition:** Devices communicate directly with each other without a central server.
- **Example:** File sharing systems like BitTorrent.

---

## **4. Specialized Networks:**

### **a) VPN (Virtual Private Network):**
- **Definition:** A secure private network that uses public internet connections for encrypted communication.
- **Example:** Remote workers accessing office resources via VPN.

### **b) IoT (Internet of Things) Network:**
- **Definition:** A network of smart devices connected to the internet and communicating with each other.
- **Example:** Smart home systems like Google Home or Alexa.

### **c) GAN (Global Area Network):**
- **Definition:** A global network connecting WANs across the world.
- **Example:** The Internet.

| **Network Type**        | **Area Covered**            | **Example**               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|
| PAN                     | Personal space (room)       | Bluetooth, Hotspot        |
| LAN                     | Building/office            | Office Wi-Fi              |
| MAN                     | City-wide                  | City government networks  |
| WAN                     | Country/continent/global   | The Internet              |
